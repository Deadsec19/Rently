o	Tailwind Design and Animations: We have implemented Tailwind CSS in our project, which provides a clean and modern design. We have also added animations and effects to enhance the user experience.
o	Full Responsiveness: Our web application is fully responsive, meaning it can be accessed and used on various devices and screen sizes.
o	Authentication: We have implemented credential authentication, Google authentication, and Github authentication to ensure secure access to the application.
o	Image Upload and Validation: We have integrated Cloudinary CDN for image upload and used react-hook-form for client form validation and handling.
o	Booking System: We have created a booking system with guest and owner cancellation features. The system also includes pricing calculation, property creation and deletion, and a favorites system.
o	Advanced Search Algorithm: Our search algorithm is advanced, allowing users to search for properties by category, date range, map location, number of guests, rooms, and bathrooms. We also filter out properties that have reservations during the desired travel date range.
o	Server-side Components: We have learned how to fetch data in server react components by directly accessing the database without an API, and how to handle files like error.tsx and loading.tsx, which are new Next 13 templating files to unify loading and error handling. We have also learned how to handle relations between Server and Child components.
